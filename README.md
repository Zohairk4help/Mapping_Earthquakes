# Mapping_Earthquakes
module 13: mapping disasters 




Project's Purpose and Brief Description: In this module, I have learnt and applied in using the Leaflet.js application programming interface to show GeoJSON earthquake data, which was received from URL, to appear on map. Not only that, but I also made myself feel accustomed to different javascript codings to have different types of markers (circles, etc) and popup messages to appear on the rendered map. i also learned how to create a default map and make different layers of maps with different map styles. In addition to that, I also learned how to create different branches in GitBash to commit and push an updated files to different branches and then later on merging all of them.
